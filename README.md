# IT-ANALYST-POWER-BI-Dashboard
This Power BI project analyzes technical support data to drive operational efficiency, boost customer satisfaction, and improve Service Level Agreement (SLA) adherence.


## 1. Executive Summary:

This Power BI project analyzes technical support data to drive operational efficiency, boost customer satisfaction, and improve Service Level Agreement (SLA) adherence. The interactive report delivers key insights into ticket volumes, response and resolution times, and customer interaction patterns across various support channels and geographic locations. Core areas of focus include identifying ticket trends, evaluating agent performance, and understanding customer satisfaction levels.

## 2. Problem Statement:

In today's technology-dependent business landscape, a deep understanding of technical support center performance is vital. This project addresses the challenge of analyzing ticket volumes, SLA compliance, and customer satisfaction metrics across different support agents, communication channels, and problem topics. The ultimate goal is to pinpoint areas requiring improvement and inform strategic decisions.

## 3. Data Sources:

The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset containing ticket-level information. This includes:

* Ticket creation timestamps
* Response and resolution durations
* Assigned agent details
* Customer satisfaction scores
* Geographic location of customers
* Categorization of the issue (topics of concern)
* Support channel used for interaction

## 4. Methodology:

The project followed a structured approach:

* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Raw data was cleansed and transformed using Power Query to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis.
* **Data Modeling:** A relational data model was created in Power BI, establishing connections between key entities such as agents, geographic locations, product groups, support topics, and individual tickets. This model facilitates comprehensive data exploration.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Ticket volume trends were identified and analyzed across different timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly).
    * Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as SLA adherence for initial response and ticket resolution times were thoroughly examined.
    * Customer satisfaction rates were explored across various dimensions, including individual support agents and specific problem topics.
* **Visualization:** Interactive dashboards and compelling visuals were developed in Power BI to effectively communicate key trends, performance metrics, and actionable insights to stakeholders.

## 5. Expected Outcomes:

This project is expected to deliver the following key outcomes:

* Identification of peak periods for technical support ticket creation.
* Detailed analysis of adherence to established Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for first response and ticket resolution.
* Actionable insights into customer satisfaction levels, segmented by support agents and problem topics.
* Clear comparisons of ticket volumes across different time segments (day, week, month).
* A comprehensive understanding of emerging trends in ticket topics, common resolutions, and preferred support channels.
* Identification of geographic patterns in ticket submissions and recurring product-related issues.

## 6. Tools and Technologies:

The following tools and technologies were utilized throughout the project:

* **Power Query:** Employed for efficient data transformation, cleaning, and shaping.
* **Data Modeling (Power BI):** Used to create a robust and relational model of the technical support data.
* **DAX Measures:** Custom Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were calculated using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), including SLA adherence rates and customer satisfaction metrics.
* **Data Visualization (Power BI):** Power BI's visualization capabilities were leveraged to create interactive and insightful dashboards.

## 7. Risks and Challenges:

The project acknowledged and addressed potential risks and challenges:

* Ensuring data accuracy and integrity during the cleaning and transformation of potentially large datasets.
* Managing the complexity of relationships within the data model to enable efficient and accurate data exploration.
* Striking a balance between providing in-depth analysis and maintaining simplicity in visualizations to cater to a diverse audience with varying levels of technical understanding.

## 8. Conclusion:

This Power BI project underscores the critical role of data-driven insights in optimizing technical support operations. The resulting interactive dashboard provides businesses with actionable intelligence to improve agent performance, consistently meet SLA targets, and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction. The strategic use of Power BI's capabilities has transformed raw data into valuable knowledge, empowering informed decision-making.
